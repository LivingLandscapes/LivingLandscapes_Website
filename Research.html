<h4>Quantifying and communicating successes in savanna restoration on
Arkansas private lands</h4>
<p>In much of the Southeastern US, lack of fire management and
subsequent woody plant encroachment in open pine savannas have led to
declines in forest stand health, degraded watershed condition, increased
fire risk, and losses of savanna-dependent species, such as Northern
Bobwhite. These negative impacts have motivated savanna restoration
efforts by private landowners, agencies, and conservation organizations
spanning local to regional scales. However, there are critical needs to
1) understand and learn from restoration outcomes and 2) communicate
restoration outcomes to landowners and partners. For example, in
Arkansas and Louisiana, the Arkansas Game &amp; Fish Commission, Lower
Mississippi Valley Joint Venture, American Bird Conservancy, NRCS, and
USFWS are working with private landowners to strategize and incentivize
savanna restoration under the “Open Pines Regional Conservation
Partnership Program”. The Arkansas Unit will help the Open Pines RCPP
coalition learn from and communicate successful savanna restoration
outcomes to private landowners. In this project, we will 1) quantify
outcomes of savanna restoration in terms of forest stand health, 2)
quantify outcomes from savanna restoration efforts in terms of quail
population and savanna bird community responses, and 3) predict outcomes
of savanna restoration efforts on lands that have not received
restoration treatments.</p>

<h4>Quantifying invasive carp range extents and impacts of invasive carp
on native fish communities using environmental DNA metabarcoding</h4>
<p>Invasive carp can have strong negative impacts on the economy,
fisheries, and species of conservation concern. The invasive carp range
continues to expand into more and more of Arkansas’ waters. Thus, there
arise two critical needs: 1) understand where the current leading edges
of the invasive carp range are located, and 2) to quantify the effects
of invasive carp presence on native fish communities. To meet these two
needs, we are proposing an Arkansas-wide eDNA metabarcoding study. The
objectives of this study are: 1) Document and update the current known
extent of invasive carp ranges in Arkansas, and 2) Quantify the effect
of invasive carp presence on native fish communities in Arkansas along
the invasion gradient. We will accomplish this by collecting eDNA in
multiple large Arkansas rivers (e.g., the Arkansas River, the Red River,
the White River), conducting DNA metabarcoding analysis, and developing
multi-species occupancy models.</p>

<h4><em>A statewide decision support tool for turkey conservation in
Arkansas: mapping habitat suitability, population growth rates, and
where management will be most impactful</em></h4>
<p>The apparent declines in wild turkey (<em>Meleagris gallopavo</em>)
populations has led to growing concern in multiple states, and Arkansas
is no exception. This has spurred the development of statewide decision
support tools, such as habitat suitability models and population density
maps, to assist in strategizing large-scale turkey conservation.
However, these tools can run afoul of multiple complications:
traditional habitat suitability models can oversimplify the diversity of
turkey-habitat associations; density maps often provide little new
information relative to habitat suitability maps; and neither of these
tools account for the reality that conservation decisions are made in
the face of complex socio-ecological landscapes, diverse and sometimes
competing stakeholders, and limited funds. Therefore, there is a
critical need to develop a decision support tool for Arkansas that 1)
incorporates spatial non-stationarity into turkey habitat suitability
analyses, 2) provides independent, spatially explicit information on
turkey population growth rates, and 3) synthesizes turkey habitat
suitability, turkey population growth rates, and relevant external
socio-ecological information to identify areas where management actions
will be most impactful and cost-efficient. Here, our overall goal is to
develop and implement a decision support tool that informs wild turkey
conservation and management strategies across Arkansas. Specifically,
our objectives are: 1) Identify and map important turkey habitat across
Arkansas using models that incorporate spatially non-stationary habitat
relationships; 2) Estimate and map population growth rates of turkeys
across Arkansas; 3) Using information from objectives 1 – 2, identify
areas with the greatest potential to positively impact turkey
populations through management; 4) Provide technical assistance for
development of public-facing data products. The models, data products,
and technical assistance we provide will put Arkansas Game &amp; Fish
Commission in an ideal position to prevent, halt, or potentially reverse
turkey declines in Arkansas.</p>

<h4><em>A National-Scale Early Detection And Ecosystem Service Impact
Assessment Tool For Invasive Terrestrial Plants</em></h4>
<p>Globally, invasive species cause trillions of dollars in damages to
ecosystem services, including agricultural production and biodiversity,
and these damages will only increase as climate change progresses. The
U.S. has adopted early detection and rapid response (EDRR) policies to
prevent spread and establishment of invasive species, but implementing a
consistent, national-scale EDRR approach has been stymied due to
difficulties in (i) accurately predicting where and when invasive
species will spread and (ii) consistently estimating invasive species’
impacts on ecosystem services. To overcome these difficulties, our
project’s overall goal is to develop and implement a consistent,
national-scale EDRR tool that can be adapted to most terrestrial
invasive plants. To achieve this goal, we will 1) develop novel early
detection methods that predict invasive species’ spread and overcome key
modeling limitations, 2) implement our early detection methods on the
model system of cogongrass (<em>Imperata cylindrica</em>), one of the
“world’s worst weeds” and current invader in the U.S., 3) estimate
cogongrass impacts on ecosystem services across a gradient of invasion,
and 4) use early detection model predictions to map losses in ecosystem
services driven by cogongrass invasion under different climate change
scenarios, and 5) publish computer code and instructional vignettes to
facilitate our EDRR tool’s application for other terrestrial invasive
plant species. By synergizing early detection models and ecosystem
service impacts, our products will empower stakeholders and private
landowners to prioritize proactive management actions at local,
regional, and national scales and maximally conserve ecosystem services
like biodiversity, timber, and livestock production.</p>

<h4><em>WildSNaP: Biodiversity in Solar through Native
Planting</em></h4>
<p>Renewable energy production is exponentially increasing worldwide to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and meet the goals of the Paris
Agreement. Solar energy has rapidly expanded across the US landscape to
meet the population’s growing energy needs, with a projected increase of
solar energy contribution from 3% of total electricity generation in
2020 to 20% in 2050. Solar production in the US is estimated to have
increased by 33.2% just in the last year. Production of small-scale
residential and commercial solar arrays has increased, but the largest
contribution of solar energy growth now comes from utility-scale solar
arrays. These arrays are frequently built in agricultural fields or
croplands, because the flat open landscape maximizes efficiency of solar
power generation and minimizes site preparation activities. There has
been a recent movement to plant low-growing native plant communities
under solar arrays to reduce the costs associated with turf grass
mowing. We are evaluating how the bird, amphibian, pollinator, bat, and
mammal communities use solar arrays with an understory of native grasses
and forbs compared to sites with turf grass as well as reference sites.

<h4><em>King Rail Nest Success and Juvenile Migratory Behavior in
Arkansas</em></h4>
<p>King Rails (<em>Rallus elegans</em>) are a secretive marsh bird
occurring in emergent wetlands across the eastern United States. King
Rails are a species of greatest conservation need in Arkansas and in
many species across their range. Despite their conservation status and
sharp population declines over the past several decades, we know very
little about King Rail breeding ecology and habitat needs, which are all
priority information needs across their range. Our previous research has
shown King Rails are successfully breeding at Choctaw West Wildlife
Management Area in southeastern Arkansas and that the majority of the
King Rails at the site are resident (they do not migrate). In this
project, we will build on our previous research by investigating 1)
whether a King Rail that has hatched to a pair of resident or migratory
parents stays resident or migratory its entire life, 2) how factors such
as water levels and vegetation structure influence King Rail nesting
success. This project will inform habitat management for breeding King
Rails at the local and regional scales.</p>

<h4><em>A rapid mapping tool for quantifying grassland management
outcomes</em></h4>
<p>In grasslands, the North American biome with the greatest loss of
biodiversity, documentation of successful restoration and management is
imperative for building large-scale restoration programs. However,
quantifying outcomes from grassland management efforts is made difficult
by the lack of tools to rapidly map and track core grassland habitats
and grassland biodiversity responses to management. In this project, we
will address this need by developing a rapid mapping tool to quantify
grassland management outcomes on public and private lands. To accomplish
this, we will complete two objectives: 1) develop a tool to identify and
map grassland habitat cores, and 2) use this tool to quantify grassland
habitat core and grassland bird community responses to management in and
surrounding three US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service Arkansas refuges,
focusing on Southeastern grassland species of conservation concern.
Tools and products from this project will facilitate grassland
management strategies in the Arkansas USFWS refuges, provide grassland
bird community and population trends, and will help determine the
applicability of this approach for public and private lands across the
Southeast region. Other collaborators include Arkansas Game &amp; Fish
Commission, USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, and Quail
Forever.</p>

<h4><em>Assessing Wild Pig Impacts to Ecosystem Services: A Case Study
on Diet, Density, and Space Use of Wild Pigs on the South Arkansas
National Wildlife Refuge Complex</em></h4>
<p>Management of invasive wild pig (<em>Sus scrofa</em>) populations
requires knowledge of local population abundance and density because
wild pigs are widespread economic and environmental pests. Additionally,
while the effects of wild pigs have been well documented on numerous
plant and wildlife communities, the potential effects of wild pigs on
avian communities have not yet been assessed. Thus, effective and
cost-efficient methods of monitoring wild pig populations must be
developed and become an integral component of management. Moreover,
little is known about the population-level effects of control efforts on
wild pig populations, in large part because methods to estimate wild pig
population abundance and density have not been developed, validated, and
applied to the same degree as they have with other large mammals. We
will use a novel, remote camera-based, modeling approach developed
recently by Moeller et al. (2018) for unmarked animals. We propose to
conduct our population estimates on the South Arkansas NWR Complex
because of its robust pig population, multiple listed species whose
current or historic range overlaps, complex lands, the ability to
collect data across multiple refuges, existing research equipment and
pig removal capabilities, preliminary pig diet and space use data, pig
impacts to adjacent private lands, and a willingness among regional
stakeholders to coordinate on this project. Additionally, we propose to
use the density estimates generated by our remote camera surveillance to
assess how the bird community responds to relative pig abundance. Pigs
can alter the vegetation community as well as the understory and forest
floor through their rutting and foraging behavior. These impacts are
likely to alter the available habitat for certain guilds of birds (e.g.,
ground nesting birds).</p>

<h4>Toward identifying candidate species for an aquatic nuisance species
watchlist in Arkansas: Customizing and improving ecological risk
screening summaries for aquatic invasive species</h4>
<p>Creating watchlists for potential high-risk invaders can serve as a
strong proactive invasive species management tool, but the biggest
challenge for creating watchlists is identifying which species out of
thousands are “high risk” for becoming harmful invaders. Rapid horizon
scans can narrow down non-native species lists from thousands of
non-native species to hundreds, and then in-depth risk screening
summaries, such as the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service’s (USFWS)
Ecological Risk Screening Summary (ERSS) protocols, can further winnow
lists down to a handful of high-risk species. However, there remain key
gaps in the USFWS ERSS protocols: the summaries are not tailored for
finer-scale ecoregions, the climatic analyses do not account for future
climate scenarios, and the literature review for understanding risks of
establishment, spread, and impacts is not standardized. To support
preventative invasive species management in Arkansas by identifying
potential watchlist species, there is a critical need to have and
implement a standardized protocol for in-depth ecological risk screening
summaries for species that are high-risk for becoming invasive in
Arkansas. To fill this need, we propose to customize and improve upon
the USFWS ERSS protocols. Our specific objectives are: 1) Customize and
make improvements on the USFWS ERSS protocols for Arkansas by (a)
tailoring climate matching to Arkansas and (b) developing and
implementing a standardized, semi-automatic systematic literature review
for high-risk species; and 2) Implement the new Arkansas ecological risk
screening summary protocols on the top 10 heighted risk freshwater fish
species identified in the U.S. Geological Survey’s Vertebrates in Trade
Horizon Scan. As a result of this project, Arkansas will have customized
and improved ecological risk screening summary protocols for conducting
in-depth risk screening of potential invasive species. We envision these
ERSS protocols will fit into an overarching workflow for proactive
invasive species management that starts with (i) horizon scanning (rapid
risk screening), moves to (ii) ecological risk screening (in-depth risk
screening for species flagged in horizon scanning), and then finishes
with (iii) considering species categorized as high-risk for addition to
an Arkansas aquatic nuisance species watchlist. This project will ensure
Arkansas has a clear set of methods for identifying potential watchlist
species.</p>

<h4><em>Breeding and Migration Ecology and Distribution and Abundance of
Arkansas King Rails</em></h4>
<p>The King Rail (<em>Rallus elegans</em>) is an emergent wetland
species of high conservation concern in Arkansas and across North
America due to significant population declines over the past several
decades. The cause of that decline is not well understood but is thought
to be caused in part by the loss of large contiguous emergent wetland
habitat they rely on for breeding. In Arkansas, King Rail abundance and
distribution are unknown, and the one site on public land in the
Arkansas Delta that hosts multiple pairs, the Freddie Black Choctaw West
WMA (hereafter Choctaw West WMA), also represents a dramatic wetland
restoration success that is critical to learn from. Here, we propose to
use the Choctaw West WMA as a focal site to 1) evaluate King Rail
breeding site fidelity, 2) evaluate King Rail breeding locations, and 3)
compare King Rail habitat and abundance to other sites across the
Arkansas Delta. We will capture and mark with transmitters spring
migrating and breeding King Rails at Choctaw West WMA to evaluate the
habitat use of individual birds at Choctaw West WMA as well as the
connectivity of the site with the rest of the annual cycle (farther
north breeding areas, and southern wintering areas). We will also
conduct marsh bird surveys within the Choctaw West WMA and across the
Arkansas Delta to quantify King Rail distribution and abundance and
compare regional habitat and landscape attributes to Choctaw West WMA
attributes. This work will provide AGFC with critical knowledge of King
Rail population dynamics, how Choctaw West WMA may function as a source
for other sites, breeding habitat needs at local, landscape, and
regional scales, and wetland restoration outcomes.</p>

<h4><em>Exploring Eastern Spotted Skunk (Spilogale putorius)
distribution and habitat suitability in Arkansas</em></h4>
<p>The Eastern Spotted Skunk (<em>Spilogale putorius</em>) presents a
unique conservation challenge: it is in dramatic decline across its
geographic range, yet its basic habitat needs are poorly understood. In
Arkansas, little is known about the distribution of the species,
particularly in the southwestern portion of the state where at least one
recent record of the species has raised interest in understanding how
widespread they might be in this region. Here, we propose 1) to use a
large number of motion-triggered wildlife cameras (~ 100 cameras) to
document the occurrence of Eastern Spotted Skunk over two winter seasons
and 2) to create Arkansas-wide habitat suitability maps for Eastern
Spotted Skunk. To meet our first objective, we will place clusters of
cameras focused on potential den and refuge sites on private properties
(pasture and timber) as well as at publicly managed prairie refuges
(i.e. Rick Evans Grandview Prairie WMA, Columbus Prairie Preserve, etc).
At each camera location, we will record macro and microhabitat variables
to correlate with skunk presence or absence. We will use data associated
with skunk detections and habitat associations to model potentially
occupied habitat in the region. To meet our second objective, we will
use nationwide Eastern Spotted Skunk location datasets alongside
remotely-sensed land cover/land use datasets to develop species
distribution models. We will then use model predictions to map habitat
suitability for Eastern Spotted Skunks across Arkansas. Results from
this study will provide baseline distributional data for Eastern Spotted
Skunk in the region, identify fine- and broad-scale habitat
associations, provide habitat suitability maps for Arkansas, and
highlight areas for skunk conservation and future monitoring.</p>

<h4><em>Risk assessment for Giant Salvinia in Arkansas waters</em></h4>
<p>Giant salvinia (<em>Salvinia molesta</em>) is the second worst
aquatic weed in the world, and in North America it causes millions of
dollars in damages per year to agriculture, fishing industries,
recreation, ecosystem health, and human health. Giant salvinia is
spreading rapidly throughout the Southeastern United States, including
Arkansas, and climate change is likely to exacerbate the risk and rate
of its spread. A preventative management approach that focuses on early
detection and rapid eradication responses will be the most successful
and cost effective. We developed and implemented a risk assessment tool
that 1) facilitates early detection of giant salvinia by quantifying
invasion risk (i.e., the probability of giant salvinia being present
given environmental conditions) in Arkansas and 2) determines the
difficulty of successfully eradication in water bodies if giant salvinia
was introduced (i.e., eradication difficulty), and 3) combines invasion
risk and eradication difficulty to rank Arkansas waters according to
preventative management priority. We found annual total precipitation,
annual minimum temperature, annual maximum temperature, boat access, and
number of days below 0 °C were the strongest drivers of giant salvinia
invasion risk. Currently in Arkansas, we found no waterbodies with zero
invasion risk, but invasion risk was greatest in the south and lowest in
the north. Invasion risk rapidly expanded northward under the highest
future climate scenario (RCP 8.5): areas in Arkansas with &gt; 60%
invasion risk increased from 546 km<sup>2</sup> to 30,219 km<sup>2</sup>
between now and 2040. For eradication difficulty, we scored 1,120
Arkansas waterbodies according to their ownership, shoreline length
(km), woody wetland area (km<sup>2</sup>), and emergent wetland area
(km<sup>2</sup>). Combining invasion risk and eradication difficulty
scores, we showed that, under current climate conditions, approximately
58% of waterbodies received prioritization ranks of “Medium-low” or
lower. Waterbodies falling into “Medium-high” to “Very High”
prioritization ranks were mostly between 33°N – 35°N latitude. Overall,
although current giant salvinia invasion risk was relatively low for
Arkansas, there was a non-zero risk throughout the State. Given the
worst future climate scenario, most of Arkansas would be at high risk of
invasion &lt; 20 years. To prevent further giant salvinia invasion in
Arkansas, our results suggest frequent monitoring of waterbodies with
high prioritization rankings and intermittent reassessment of invasion
risk as the climate changes. </p>

<h4><em>Impacts of Egyptian Geese and other invasive aquatic
avifauna</em></h4>
<p>Globally, invasive species are one of the biggest drivers of
biodiversity and agricultural losses. Motivating and implementing
invasive species management before they become overwhelming problems is
the most cost effective way to manage invasive species. In Arkansas and
many other Southeastern states, Egyptian Geese (<em>Alopochen
aegyptiaca</em>), a known pest and invader in Europe, are increasing in
abundance and distribution. Here, we seek to 1) synthesize existing
scientific literature on the impacts of Egyptian Geese and other
invasive aquatic avifauna on native ecosystems and agroecosystems and 2)
determine current distribution of Egyptian Goose in Arkansas via field
surveys. This project is a collaboration between the Arkansas
Cooperative Fish &amp; Wildlife Research Unit and Arkansas Game &amp;
Fish Commission. Results from this project will arm cooperators with the
state of knowledge on impacts of invasive aquatic birds on native
species and ecosystems. It will also provide Arkansas Game &amp; Fish
Commission with information to develop management policies for Egyptian
Geese.</p>
