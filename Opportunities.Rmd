The Living Landscapes Lab is part of the [Arkansas Cooperative Fish & Wildlife Research Unit](https://www1.usgs.gov/coopunits/unit/Arkansas). That means our mission is to co-produce research with and provide support for our cooperators at Arkansas Game & Fish Commission, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, the Wildlife Management Institute, and the public. Students will have unique opportunities to work closely with cooperators on issues that will directly apply to state, regional, and national conservation decisions and management.

So if you're interested in landscapes, global change, invasive species, ecological resilience, wildlife, rangelands, plants, complex adaptive systems, or agroecosystems, check below or send me an email with your CV and research interests (cr065@uark.edu). I'm actively looking for students and post-docs to join the lab!

#### We're commited to diversity, equity, and inclusion

In the Living Landscapes Lab, we seek to create, keep, and spread a climate of positivity and inclusiveness. We embrace and encourage lab members’ differences in age, color, disability, ethnicity, family or marital status, gender identity or expression, language, race, religion, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, and other characteristics that make us unique. To these ends, the Living Landscapes Lab encourages and enforces:

- Respectful communication and cooperation
- The need for both words and action to combat systemic inequities
- Collaboration -- not competition
- The importance of every voice 
- The value of life outside of the lab
