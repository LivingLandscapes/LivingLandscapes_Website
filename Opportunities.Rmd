<!-- ## Postdoctoral Fellow: Wild Turkey Population Ecology -->

<!-- ### Project Description: -->

<!-- We seek a Postdoctoral Fellow in Population/Spatial Ecology at the Arkansas Cooperative Fish & Wildlife Research Unit, housed in the University of Arkansas Department of Biological Sciences. Overall, we are looking for a positive and creative individual with strong oral and written communication skills. The successful applicant will have the ability to be both an independent and motivated problem solver and collaborative team member capable of co-producing relevant science with scientists and on-the-ground practitioners. -->

<!-- This position is funded by the Arkansas Game & Fish Commission. The primary duty of the postdoctoral fellow will be to estimate and map population growth rates of turkeys across Arkansas using integrated population models. Additional duties will include identifying areas with the greatest potential to positively impact turkey populations through management and providing technical assistance for development of public-facing data products such as Shiny apps, data communications, etc. There is also an opportunity to analyze a large extant Acoustic Recording Unit database to assess savanna, glade, and grassland restoration outcomes across Arkansas. The Postdoctoral Fellow will be part of the Arkansas Cooperative Fish & Wildlife Research Unit and will work closely with a team comprised of University faculty, U.S. Geological Survey scientists, and Arkansas Game & Fish Commission Wildlife and Private Lands Divisions. Scientific and data products from this research will directly support conservation decision-making in Arkansas. -->

<!-- The position will ideally be located in Fayetteville, AR, at the University of Arkansas Department of Biological Sciences, but fully remote-work will be considered for exceptional candidates within the U.S. Fayetteville is listed as one of the best places to live in the US and has many wonderful outdoor recreation opportunities including the Ozark-St. Francis National Forest, the Buffalo National Scenic River, and world-class mountain biking trails. This is a full-time, Postdoctoral Fellow position with salary depending on experience ($60,000-$65,000 per year). Funding is also available for 1 national conference, 1 regional conference, and travel to meet with collaborators. This is a 1-year appointment, renewable based on the need for the position, availability of funding, and continued satisfactory level of performance in the role. Regular, reliable, and non-disruptive attendance is an essential job duty, as is the ability to create and maintain collegial, harmonious working relationships with others.   -->

<!-- ### Qualifications: -->

<!-- #### Minimum Qualifications: -->

<!-- - PhD in Ecology, Biology, or a related field with a strong quantitative background  -->

<!-- #### Preferred Qualifications: -->

<!-- -	Experience with R and analyzing spatial data using GIS, Google Earth Engine, etc. -->
<!-- -	Proficiency in integrated population modeling -->
<!-- -	Record of success conducting research, evidenced by publication in peer-reviewed journals  -->
<!-- -	Strong organizational, leadership, and communication skills to co-produce and conduct a research project with numerous collaborators (e.g., natural resource agencies, university faculty, private land owners, etc.). -->

<!-- ### Salary and Appointment: -->

<!-- - \$60,000 - \$65,000 -->
<!-- - This is a 1-year appointment, renewable based on the need for the position, availability of funding, and continued satisfactory level of performance in the role. -->

Letters will only be requested for a short-list of applicants.  -->

<!-- Please also feel free to reach out to Dr. Roberts if you have additional questions or would like to schedule a conversation. Looking forward to seeing your application in the pool! -->


<!-- ## Ph.D. Assistantship – Invasion ecology: early detection + impacts -->

<!-- ### Basic info -->

<!-- - Location: University of Arkansas, Department of Biological Sciences, Fayetteville, AR -->

<!-- - Salary: \$18,800 plus potential additive fellowships up to $22,000/year -->

<!-- ### Description -->

<!-- I am looking for a doctoral student with a collaborative spirit, a creative mind, and strong interest in applied ecology and natural resources management. The student will be part of the University of Arkansas Department of Biological Sciences, the Arkansas Cooperative Fish & Wildlife Research Unit, and the Living Landscapes Lab. The student will lead a 4-year project on improving early detection models for invasive plants using Bayesian modeling, mechanistic dispersal modeling, and geospatial analyses. The focal species will be cogongrass (*Imperata cylindrica*), the ‘seventh worst weed in the world.’ There are many opportunities to work in wildlife-related research (e.g., impacts of cogongrass on ground-nesting birds). -->

<!-- The student will work with a diverse group of researchers from the USDA Agricultural Research Service, the University of Florida, the U.S. Forest Service, and Michigan State University. The student will also collaborate closely with another Ph.D. student at the University of Florida, who will focus on ecosystem service impacts (fire risk modeling, biodiversity effects) of cogongrass.  -->

<!-- The student’s stipend will be paid via a research assistantship. The research assistantship will cover the student’s salary year-round. Tuition will be waived. In addition to the salary, the University of Arkansas also offers [fellowships](https://graduate-and-international.uark.edu/graduate/costs-and-funding/fellowships-scholarships/doctoral-fellowships.php) that can substantially increase student salary.  -->

<!-- ### Qualifications -->

<!-- - Strong organizational, leadership, and communication skills to co-produce and conduct a research project with collaborators (e.g., natural resource agencies, university faculty, etc.).  -->

<!-- - Experience using GIS software (e.g., QGIS, ESRI, R geospatial packages). -->

<!-- - Proficiency in at least one statistical programming language (e.g., R, Julia, Python). -->

<!-- - Background in statistics, preferably Bayesian modeling and spatial analyses. -->

<!-- - A Master’s degree from a natural resources, biology, ecology, wildlife, fisheries, agronomy, or closely-related program.  -->

<!-- - Commitment to publishing peer-reviewed scientific articles and present research at conferences. -->

<!-- - Fortitude to work in challenging field conditions (e.g., heat, humidity, cold, rain, etc.). -->

<!-- - Suitable grades per [University of Arkansas Graduate School requirements](https://graduate-and-international.uark.edu/graduate/future-students/applying/degree-seeking.php). -->
