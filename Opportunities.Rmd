## M.S. Assistantship – Birds, solar arrays, and native plantings

### Basic info

- Start date: Spring or Summer 2024

- Last date to apply: 10/1/2023

- **NOTE: applications will be reviewed as they are received!**

- Salary: $18,800/year

### Description

I am looking for a collaborative and creative master’s student with interests in natural resources management, renewable energy, and birds. The student will be part of the University of Arkansas Department of Biological Sciences, the Arkansas Cooperative Fish & Wildlife Research Unit, and the Living Landscapes Lab. The student will lead a 2-year project on how birds use solar arrays with an understory of native grasses and forbs compared to sites with turf grass as well as reference sites. This project is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and includes a large team of graduate students and scientists at the University of Arkansas. This position will entail frequent travel for field work across Arkansas and Kansas, and the student will have the opportunity to assist fellow graduate students in collecting reptile, amphibian, mammal, insect, and plant diversity field data.

The student’s stipend will be paid via a research assistantship (i.e., no teaching required). Tuition will be waived. The start date is flexible (January – May 2024). Field work will begin May 2024.

### Qualifications

- Strong organizational, leadership, and communication skills to co-produce and conduct a research project with numerous collaborators (e.g., natural resource agencies, university faculty, private land owners, etc.). 

- Commitment to publishing peer-reviewed scientific articles and present research at conferences.

- Fortitude to work in challenging field conditions (e.g., heat, humidity, cold, rain, etc.).

- Suitable grades per University of Arkansas Graduate School requirements (https://graduate-and-international.uark.edu/graduate/future-students/applying/degree-seeking.php).

- A valid US driver’s license or ability/willingness to obtain one prior to starting this position.

## Ph.D. Assistantship – Invasion ecology: early detection + impacts

### Basic info

- Location: University of Arkansas, Department of Biological Sciences, Fayetteville, AR

- Salary: \$18,800 plus potential additive fellowships up to $22,000/year

- Start date: Fall 2023 or Spring 2024

- **Applications will be reviewed as they are received!**

### Description

I am looking for a doctoral student with a collaborative spirit, a creative mind, and strong interest in applied ecology and natural resources management. The student will be part of the University of Arkansas Department of Biological Sciences, the Arkansas Cooperative Fish & Wildlife Research Unit, and the Living Landscapes Lab. The student will lead a 4-year project on improving early detection models for invasive plants using Bayesian modeling, mechanistic dispersal modeling, and geospatial analyses. The focal species will be cogongrass (*Imperata cylindrica*), the ‘seventh worst weed in the world.’ There are many opportunities to work in wildlife-related research (e.g., impacts of cogongrass on ground-nesting birds).

The student will work with a diverse group of researchers from the USDA Agricultural Research Service, the University of Florida, the U.S. Forest Service, and Michigan State University. The student will also collaborate closely with another Ph.D. student at the University of Florida, who will focus on ecosystem service impacts (fire risk modeling, biodiversity effects) of cogongrass. 

The student’s stipend will be paid via a research assistantship. The research assistantship will cover the student’s salary year-round. Tuition will be waived. In addition to the salary, the University of Arkansas also offers [fellowships](https://graduate-and-international.uark.edu/graduate/costs-and-funding/fellowships-scholarships/doctoral-fellowships.php) that can substantially increase student salary. 

### Qualifications

- Strong organizational, leadership, and communication skills to co-produce and conduct a research project with collaborators (e.g., natural resource agencies, university faculty, etc.). 

- Experience using GIS software (e.g., QGIS, ESRI, R geospatial packages).

- Proficiency in at least one statistical programming language (e.g., R, Julia, Python).

- Background in statistics, preferably Bayesian modeling and spatial analyses.

- A Master’s degree from a natural resources, biology, ecology, wildlife, fisheries, agronomy, or closely-related program. 

- Commitment to publishing peer-reviewed scientific articles and present research at conferences.

- Fortitude to work in challenging field conditions (e.g., heat, humidity, cold, rain, etc.).

- Suitable grades per [University of Arkansas Graduate School requirements](https://graduate-and-international.uark.edu/graduate/future-students/applying/degree-seeking.php).
