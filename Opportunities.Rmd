<!-- ## MS Research Assistantship: King Rail Breeding Ecology -->

<!-- ### Project Description:  -->

<!-- A Masters of Science research assistant position is available starting the Spring 2025 Semester at the University of Arkansas Fayetteville. A detailed research proposal describing objectives, data collection, and analyses as well as a written thesis are partial requirements of the Masters of Science degree.  -->

<!-- The project is focused on the King Rail in southeastern Arkansas. The successful candidate will lead a technician in collecting data about nest success and movement ecology of juvenile King Rails, assessing the role water level management plays in King Rail breeding success. -->
<!-- Research activities will be conducted in southeastern King Rail from March-July 2025 and 2026.  The student will work closely in collaboration with the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission during the field work and throughout the project.  Travel costs, including rustic housing, will be provided while in the field. -->

<!-- The student will work with a diverse group of researchers from the USDA Agricultural Research Service, the University of Florida, the U.S. Forest Service, and Michigan State University. The student will also collaborate closely with another Ph.D. student at the University of Florida, who will focus on ecosystem service impacts (fire risk modeling, biodiversity effects) of cogongrass.  -->

<!-- The student’s stipend will be paid via a research assistantship. The research assistantship will cover the student’s salary year-round. Tuition will be waived. In addition to the salary, the University of Arkansas also offers [fellowships](https://graduate-and-international.uark.edu/graduate/costs-and-funding/fellowships-scholarships/doctoral-fellowships.php) that can substantially increase student salary.  -->
