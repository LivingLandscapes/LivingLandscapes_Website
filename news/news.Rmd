February 2022

- Big news!! We got a grant with the US Fish & Wildlife Service to develop a mapping tool to quantify grassland management outcomes. See the new project on the [Research](https://livinglandscapes.github.io/LivingLandscapes_Website/Research.html) page.
- We're hiring two summer technicians!! Check out the [job ad](https://wfscjobs.tamu.edu/jobs/bird-vegetation-survey-technicians-2-for-eastern-arkansas/) for more information.
- Also, if you're interested in ecological resilience and think "wombling" is a hilarious word, check out our new [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X22000383) in *Ecological Indicators*.

November 2021

- +1 article for November: [Dr. DeGregorio's lab](https://degregoriolab.weebly.com/) and I collaborated to investigate responses of nine-banded armadillo activity patterns to human development/noise. Check it out in [Ecology and Evolution](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.8257)!
- Welcome to our new MS student and secretive marshbird expert, Jess Schmit! Jess will start in spring 2022, and she will be co-advised by Caleb and [Dr. Fournier](http://aurielfournier.github.io/about/). Jess will study King Rail migration and habitat usage.
- Our new article in [Ecological Applications](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eap.2480)
shows how new tech/methods can provide early warnings of woody invasions and help rapidly adapt management. Stay tuned for more press on this one!
