December 2022

- "Americaâ€™s Billion-Dollar Tree Problem Is Spreading". Now that's a catchy headline. Check out the [Wired magazine](https://www.wired.com/story/billion-dollar-encroaching-tree-problem/) that covers our [Journal of Applied Ecology](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.14288) and [Journal of Environmental Management](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479722019326?dgcid=author) articles!

November 2022

- How much does tree invasion of grasslands cost western US economies? Billions. Check out our new [Journal of Applied Ecology](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.14288) article for the details.
- Our own [Percy Marshall](https://livinglandscapes.github.io/LivingLandscapes_Website/People.html) has published their first peer-reviewed manuscript in [Crop Science](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261219422002125)! Spoiler: hummingbirds can help control orchard pest insects!

October 2022

- New technologies allow us to rapidly learn from rangeland management actions like prescribed fire, grazing, and tree removal at scales from 30m2 pixels to biomes! Check out our brand new [Journal of Environmental Management](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479722019326?dgcid=author) manuscript to learn more.
- We're kicking off a new research project on risk of [giant salvinia](https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/aquatic/plants/giant-salvinia) invasion. See our [research tab](https://livinglandscapes.github.io/LivingLandscapes_Website/Research.html) to learn more!

August 2022

- [Ken Wilson](https://livinglandscapes.github.io/LivingLandscapes_Website/People.html) joined the Living Landscapes Lab this fall! Ken will be quantifying feral hog impacts on vegetation and ground-nesting birds in southeastern Arkansas USFWS refuges. Welcome, Ken!
- Speaking of Ken's project, check out the new project we're kickstarting this fall: [Assessing Wild Pig Impacts to Ecosystem Services: A Case Study on Diet, Density, and Space Use of Wild Pigs on the South Arkansas National Wildlife Refuge Complex](https://livinglandscapes.github.io/LivingLandscapes_Website/Research.html). This is a USFWS/USGS funded project, and we're very excited to get into the messy world of feral hogs.
