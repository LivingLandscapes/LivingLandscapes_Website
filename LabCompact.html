<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Living Landscapes Lab Mentor-Mentee
Compact</h1>

</div>


<div id="overview" class="section level2">
<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>This mentor-mentee compact outlines 1) what you as a graduate student
mentee can expect from me, 2) what I as a mentor expect from you, and 3)
other important details about data, authorship, etc. If you are a Living
Landscapes member, will be a member soon, or are interested in joining,
please read this compact carefully. This is not a contract. It is a
living document, meaning it can and will evolve with your input and my
experience. I’m looking forward to working with you, getting amazing
conservation research done, and supporting your professional growth!</p>
<div id="what-to-expect-from-me" class="section level3">
<h3>WHAT TO EXPECT FROM ME</h3>
<p>Overall, my goal is to help students develop into colleagues in the
natural resources management field. That’s what the USGS Coop Units are
all about!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I will respect all students as individuals without regard to
gender, race, national origin, religion, disability, health issues, or
sexual orientation, and I will foster a climate of positivity in the
lab.</strong> I will also not tolerate harassment based on any of these
things.</li>
<li><strong>I will be committed to help provide financial resources for
the graduate student to conduct their thesis/dissertation
research.</strong> I will discuss and agree to funding details with
students prior to hiring them. Normally, I will only hire students when
I have grant funds to support RA (meaning the student doesn’t have to
teach to support themselves). However, if funding changes, I will notify
students the semester before they need to TA.</li>
<li><strong>I will be committed to each student’s research
project.</strong> I will work with each student to help guide and plan
the research project, set attainable goals, and a timeline for
completion of the project.</li>
<li><strong>I will be committed to meeting one-on-one with students on a
regular basis.</strong> I will regularly review student progress and
provide timely feedback and goal setting advice. I will make time to
have weekly one-on-one meetings with students in addition to weekly lab
meetings. Also, if my door is open, please pop in and ask questions. I’m
here to help.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>If I am concerned about a student’s research progress or
other work-related issues, I will quickly and directly address issues
with the student.</strong> If I notice a pattern of poor research
productivity, time management, or issues with how students interact with
Cooperators or fellow lab members, I will address these in a timely
manner through a one-on-one conversation. We can jointly make a plan to
get back on track.</li>
<li><strong>I will promote student training in professional skills
needed for a successful career.</strong> These skills include oral and
written communication, writing grants (this will mostly be for/with PhD
students), time management, collaborative research, networking, working
with Cooperators and practitioners, teaching, and mentoring. I will
encourage the student to seek opportunities to develop skills in these
areas outside the lab as well.</li>
<li><strong>I will encourage and foster each student’s professional
network.</strong> I will help guide students, if necessary, in finding
appropriate external mentors, particularly in the fields and
organizations that the student is interested in working for. These
external mentors will be your network as you move forward in a
scientific career. However, it is up to YOU to cultivate these
relationships.</li>
<li><strong>I will set an example for work-life balance.</strong> Just
like you, I have a life outside of work. I love spending time with my
family, traveling, running, reading, hiking, camping, playing board
games/table-top RPGs, gardening, and cooking. To make sure I can do all
those things, I try to work efficiently during “normal” business hours
(0800 – 1630 CT weekdays). That means I will likely not answer emails
outside of those times, unless it’s an emergency.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-i-expect-from-you" class="section level3">
<h3>WHAT I EXPECT FROM YOU</h3>
<div id="professional-interactions" class="section level4">
<h4>Professional interactions</h4>
<ul>
<li>The first rule of our lab is to be respectful to everyone.<br />
</li>
<li>The second rule is that students will be professional in all
interactions with the Unit’s Cooperators (Arkansas Game &amp; Fish
Commission, US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, US Geological Survey,
University of Arkansas). This means that students will meet their
obligations to Cooperators, attend required Cooperator meetings, and
always seek to present a good image to our Cooperators. This is
foundational to the Coop Unit program.</li>
<li>I expect you to write professional e-mails.</li>
<li>If you are taking the lead on communicating with other groups
outside of the lab for a research project, I will set up the initial
interaction. I may ask the student to lead subsequent interactions. I
expect to be ’ccd on important e-mails. You are responsible for
identifying ahead of time what constitutes an “important
communication.”</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="lab-interactions" class="section level4">
<h4>Lab interactions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Treat other lab members with respect.</li>
<li>You will be an active contributing member to all team efforts and
collaborations and will respect individual contributions. You will
contribute to an environment that is safe, equitable, and free of
harassment.</li>
<li>You are encouraged to participate in lab-wide fun activities and to
foster a fun and welcoming lab community. For example, I host cookouts
at my house ~2 times each year. We celebrate when lab mates graduate or
have major achievements. We sometimes go on hikes or field site visits
as a lab.</li>
<li>If you have issues with a particular lab member, think about the
best way to approach the situation. When you are calm, try to initiate a
conversation about your frustrations and resolve the issue. If you need
help managing these situations, talk to me.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="work-habits-organization-and-time-management"
class="section level4">
<h4>Work habits, organization, and time management</h4>
<ul>
<li>You have the primary responsibility for successfully completing your
degree. This includes commitment to your work in class and in the lab.
You should maintain a high level of professionalism, motivation,
engagement, scientific curiosity, and ethical standards.</li>
<li>Attend and be prepared for our one-on-one meetings and lab meetings.
I provide my best feedback when students organize questions, data,
results, presentations, and writing before meeting with me. I expect
students to drive one-on-one meeting agendas. IMPORTANT: I can’t provide
feedback if you don’t give me something tangible to review.</li>
<li>Try to figure out answers on your own before approaching me. Bend
your considerable ingenuity to finding answers from your lab mates, the
internet, etc. You’re an aspiring scientist, and you can totally do
this! However, I’m absolutely here to help and answer questions. I don’t
want you to waste too much time spinning your wheels, so if you feel
like you’re completely stumped with writing, coding, study design, etc.,
let me know!</li>
<li>Know and comply with the policies, deadlines, requirements of the
graduate program, school, university, and Arkansas Coop Unit. Complete
all your USGS safety trainings, university trainings, etc. in a timely
manner. Graduation, enrollment, registration, deadlines, and
requirements can change, and it is your responsibility to stay apprised.
- Be present in the office during normal-ish business hours at least 2 –
3 times weekly. Normal-ish business hours in my lab are 0800 – 1630 CT
Monday through Friday, although I do not require students to come and
leave at a defined time each day. The obvious exceptions are during the
student’s field season, vacation, and university closures. Taking
breaks, working odd hours, etc. is okay. That’s grad school life! But if
you are not disciplined and multitasking, it can take you 60 hours to
complete what a disciplined student can in 40 hours. I expect people are
actively working ~ 40h per week (reading, etc. is part of this).
Sometimes it is necessary to put in extra time to meet deadlines.</li>
<li>Strive to meet deadlines and manage your progress.<br />
</li>
<li>Organize your work for each week, semester, and year. Create and
maintain a list of short-, medium- and long-term goals with deadline to
keep you on track. Calibrate your lists to make them attainable so you
don’t burn out, but also be ambitious. Time never stands still, and
things (particularly writing) always take longer than you think they
will.</li>
<li>Strive for a healthy work-life balance. You are more than your work
and research. Do something that gives you joy every day. Get enough
sleep. Embrace and grow your mental, physical, and spiritual health.
Research is a long game, and a centered person can be more disciplined,
creative, and productive.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="holidays-breaks-and-vacation" class="section level4">
<h4>Holidays, Breaks, and Vacation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Students are not expected to work when the university is closed for
holidays or breaks. These holidays and breaks are defined by the
University of Arkansas.<br />
</li>
<li>Each student also has 2 additional weeks of vacation a year.
Importantly, this is a Living Landscapes Lab policy—not a university
policy. Let me know as far ahead of time as possible if/when you will be
going on vacation. I require a written request 1 month in advance of a
one-week vacation, and longer if you plan on taking all your vacation at
once. You are responsible for organizing the care of your experiments,
fieldwork, classes, etc. during your vacation. I reserve the right to
not approve vacation requests if deadlines are not being met, Cooperator
relationships are on the line, etc. Graduate students do not get summers
off or spring break off: students need to request vacation if they want
time off during summer or spring break (see the official university
holidays and closures).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="authorship-publications-and-sharing-materials"
class="section level4">
<h4>Authorship, Publications, and Sharing Materials</h4>
<ul>
<li>I typically do not decide order of authorship at the beginning of a
project. Things can change over time and some individuals may end up
contributing more than others. When it is clear we have a publishable
story that is over half finished, I will meet with the group and we can
decide authorship order.</li>
<li>I expect the first author to perform most of the work, take the lead
on writing the paper, and take the lead on journal revisions. I will
work with each student to help plan how to write each section, sketch
out figures, provide general feedback, and polish each paper.</li>
<li>We adhere to the Ecological Society of America’s authorship
criteria.</li>
<li>Students will adhere to all USGS FSP policies. If you don’t know
what this is, ask me for instructions.</li>
<li>Before submitting any paper, I require all computer code to be
annotated and placed in a shared OneDrive folder. I also require
metadata files for all data.</li>
